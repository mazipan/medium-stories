I keep writing even my time was too much waste because my job as full time engineer needs very focus everyday. I also need to spare my time to my lovely family because I have beautiful wife and child. I keep writing while many people doesnâ€™t think that writing is worth for them.</p><p name="13c6" id="13c6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is my explanation, at least from my opinionÂ :</p><p name="16de" id="16de" class="graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf-after--p"><span class="graf-dropCap">F</span><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">irst</strong>, because I believe that my post is my manifestation for my future. I have shared anything that I want, mostly is unimportant things, but when I look into my blog statistics and guess whatÂ ? Will be always there are people reading your post even itâ€™s not very important for most people. Knowing that people needs your articles was very boost for my mood to keep writing anything.</p><p name="6316" id="6316" class="graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf-after--p"><span class="graf-dropCap">S</span><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">econd</strong> thing is because I still believe that writing is one of step to saving our knowledge, because our brain is have too much things to be remembered everyday and we canâ€™t push that brain to remember all the things. So writing in blog or anything is saving your knowledge that will remembering you someday if you forgot about that thing. Itâ€™s funny thing when someday you find something in Google for solving any problem then you found your own blog in Google search result.Â <br>Hahahaâ€¦ I have been that moment ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚<br>Yes, I keep writing because I am not good in remembering anything. I am forgetful even for a simple thing. I never remember <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">syntax of code</em> that wrote everyday. My daily job was searching in internet for many complex and simple <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">syntax</em> that I forgot. I am <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V Programmer</em>.</p><p name="f0d2" id="f0d2" class="graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf-after--p"><span class="graf-dropCap">T</span><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">hird</strong>, I still believe until today, when you sharing anything to another people you will never loss that thing, you just make your own to have more deep understanding in that thing. You never know that your simple things is have big impact for your reader. I have writing about basic HTML knowledge that I think itâ€™s too basic for all web programmer but unfortunately there are some people that say thanks about that post. So donâ€™t underestimate your self.</p><p name="1b95" id="1b95" class="graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf-after--p"><span class="graf-dropCap">F</span><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">ourth</strong>, I try to positioned my self as a student that looking for a solution from senior developer outside there, imagine if all senior developer wonâ€™t to share their knowledge to UsÂ ? I must be very confuse for solving my problem everyday. Because I feel very happy when found a solution from stranger people in internet, so I also want to be part of another people happiness with writing some article that I think will be solve another people problem or at least my problem for now.<br>You must be know if will be coming a time for Us as young developer to replace their position. So, it will be better to start as soon as possible to train our self in writing with good composition, clear definition, and easy to understand.</p><p name="e510" id="e510" class="graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf-after--p graf--trailing"><span class="graf-dropCap">F</span>inally, with all my believing in writing, I very suggest for all programmers to start writing anything, you can write your life story, your family, your opinion, your code style, your problem, your solving, your algorithm and all things you can write into a post.<br>You will be get so much advantage from your every articles published.<br>You can help another people outside there.<br>You can share your knowledge and experience to other people.</p></div></div></section><section name="bbaa" class="section section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><h3 name="3b32" id="3b32" class="graf graf--h3 graf--leading">Conclusion</h3><p name="fe2f" id="fe2f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">I think just one conclusion, letâ€™s start writing your own story, Programmersâ€¦</p><blockquote name="04e8" id="04e8" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p graf--trailing">Wrote with love by <a href="https://medium.com/u/d09eac079a9c" data-href="https://medium.com/u/d09eac079a9c" data-anchor-type="2" data-user-id="d09eac079a9c" data-action-value="d09eac079a9c" data-action="show-user-card" data-action-type="hover" class="markup--user markup--blockquote-user" target="_blank">Irfan Maulana</a></blockquote></div></div></section>
